What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year?

What is the average price of a home for each year it was built with three bedrooms and three bathrooms?

What is the average price of a home with three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and two floors each year, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet?
